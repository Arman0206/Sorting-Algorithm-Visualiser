#Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based visualizer that demonstrates how popular sorting
algorithms work step-by-step. The project helps users intuitively understand
algorithm behavior, comparisons, and swaps through real-time animations.

---

#Features

- Visualizes multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Random array generation
- Animated comparisons and swaps
- Color-coded bars for active, unsorted, and sorted elements
- Clean and responsive user interface

---

#Technologies Used

- HTML5 – structure and layout
- CSS3 – styling and animations
- JavaScript (ES6) – algorithm implementation and DOM manipulation

---

# Algorithms Implemented

### Bubble Sort
- Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

### Selection Sort
- Selects the minimum element and places it in the correct position
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

### Insertion Sort
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

#How to Use

1. Click **Generate Array** to create a random array
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown
3. Click **Sort** to visualize the algorithm step-by-step
4. Observe comparisons, swaps, and final sorted output

# Future Improvements

- Add Merge Sort and Quick Sort
- Display time and space complexity dynamically
- Speed control slider
- Step-by-step execution mode
- React-based implementation
